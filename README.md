First time instructions:

Run `bin/setup; bin/dev` to install dependencies, prepare the database, and start the server.

Then go to `localhost:3000` to sign in with the test user:

```
username: demo@example.com
password: password
```

From here, you can add flights and see the data displayed on the root page with the map ui.
